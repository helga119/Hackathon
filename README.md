# Hackathon
In this hackathon, we leveraged the power of transfer learning to build image classification models using one of the provided datasets. We developed, implemented, and evaluated a high-performing image classifier. The goal was to effectively use a pre-trained deep learning model, fine-tune it for the specific dataset, and optimise its performance through hyperparameter tuning.
